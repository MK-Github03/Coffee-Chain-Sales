## Project Overview:
This project is part of the final requirements for the course **DSC 424: Advanced Data Analysis**. Our objective is to apply multivariate techniques to analyze a large dataset. Specifically, we are using sales data from a coffee chain to uncover patterns, create predictive models, and derive actionable business insights.

### Dataset:
The dataset we are using contains sales data from a coffee chain, with information such as product categories, regional sales, profits, and various time periods. It contains a diverse mix of both categorical and continuous variables, making it suitable for the multivariate analyses covered in this course.

- **Dataset file**: `Coffee_Chain_Sales.csv`
- **Total Variables**: Over 20 variables, including metric, ordinal, and categorical types.
- **Observations**: 400+ entries, fulfilling the project requirements.

## Goals of the Project:
Our analysis aims to address the following:

- **Predictive Modeling**: Develop models to predict continuous variables such as sales and profit.
- **Classification**: Use techniques like discriminant analysis to classify regions, products, or customer types based on various features.
- **Clustering**: Uncover new classifications or groups in the data, such as segments of customers or regions with similar sales behavior.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Explore the relationships between different variables using techniques like regression, PCA, and clustering.

## Analytical Techniques:
We will use a mix of **relational techniques** and **classification methods**. These include but are not limited to:

- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: For dimensionality reduction and detecting patterns.
- **Linear and Logistic Regression**: For both prediction and classification tasks.
- **Cluster Analysis**: To discover natural groupings within the data.
- **Discriminant Analysis**: To classify categorical variables and assess the accuracy of classification.
  
Each analysis will be evaluated using proper statistical validation techniques like cross-validation (e.g., k-fold), residual diagnostics, and accuracy measures to ensure the robustness of our models.

## Project Structure:
- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for analysis.
- `notebooks/`: Contains Jupyter notebooks for data cleaning, exploration, and analysis.
- `reports/`: Final project reports, including both technical and non-technical summaries.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for various analyses (PCA, clustering, regression models, etc.).
- `visualizations/`: Plots and graphs generated during the analysis.

### Deliverables:
1. **Non-Technical Summary**: A report summarizing our findings for a non-technical audience.
2. **Technical Summary**: Detailed statistical analysis and modeling report with graphs.
3. **Individual Contributions**: Each team member will provide a 1-2 page report detailing their specific contributions and learnings from the project.

## Tools & Technologies:
We are using the following tools for our analysis:
- **Python**: For data processing and model building (pandas, scikit-learn, statsmodels, etc.).
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: For organizing the code and visualizations.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For generating graphs and visualizations.
- **Other tools**: R, SAS, or SPSS as needed for specialized analyses.



## Conclusion:
This project will combine multiple multivariate techniques to draw insights from sales data. Our goal is to provide actionable conclusions that could improve the operations of a coffee chain, based on sales, profits, and customer segmentation.
