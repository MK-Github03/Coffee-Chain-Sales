# **Coffee Chain Sales Data Analysis**

## **Project Overview**
This project focuses on applying multivariate techniques to analyze a large sales dataset from a coffee chain. The objective is to uncover patterns, develop predictive models, and derive actionable business insights from the data.

## **Dataset**
The dataset contains sales information, including product categories, regional sales, profits, and time-based trends. It includes a mix of categorical and continuous variables, making it suitable for advanced analytical techniques.

- **Dataset File**: [`Coffee_Chain_Sales.csv`](https://github.com/midnightsun257/Coffee-Chain-Sales/blob/main/Updated_Coffee_Chain_Sales.csv)
- **Total Variables**: Over 20 variables, including metric, ordinal, and categorical types.
- **Observations**: 400+ entries.

## **Project Goals**
The analysis aims to achieve the following:

- **Predictive Modeling**: Develop models to predict continuous variables such as sales and profit.
- **Classification**: Use techniques such as discriminant analysis to classify regions, products, or customer types based on features.
- **Clustering**: Identify new customer segments or regions with similar sales behaviors.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Examine relationships between variables using regression, PCA, and clustering.

## **Analytical Techniques**
The project utilizes a combination of statistical and machine learning techniques, including:

- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: For dimensionality reduction and pattern detection.
- **Linear & Logistic Regression**: For prediction and classification.
- **Cluster Analysis**: To discover natural groupings in the data.
- **Discriminant Analysis**: To classify categorical variables and assess classification accuracy.

Each method will be validated using appropriate statistical techniques such as cross-validation, residual diagnostics, and accuracy metrics.

## **Project Structure**
The analysis and deliverables are structured as follows:
